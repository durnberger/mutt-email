# Referring to the example below, the numbers 4 & 26 indicate that the columns are 
# 4 & 26 characters wide respectively. These numbers can be adjusted as required.
#
# Referrring to the setting '%-xx.xxL', the first number defines the column width.
# The second number defines the space available for the text. If for example the 
# setting was configured as '-20.26L' the space available for the text would be
# longer than the maximum column width. To keep the index page tidy, ideally the
# first digit should be the same as or greater than the second digit.
